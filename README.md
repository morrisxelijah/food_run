# 🏃 food run 🛒

A full stack typescript web app that helps home cooks generate bulk grocery lists from online recipes and plan out their meal prep.

## Goals

- allow users to paste recipe urls and import ingredient data
- aggregate ingredients from multiple recipes into a single shopping list
- adjust the shopping list based on pantry items the user already has
- practice building a mono repo with a react + vite client and express + postgres server
- gain experience with testing using vitest and optional authentication and api integrations
